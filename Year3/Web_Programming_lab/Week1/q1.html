        <h1> Whisper in the Woods-By Robert Frost</h1>
        The trees stand tall in quiet <b>grace</b>,<br>
        A hush of winter on their <b>face</b>.<br>
        The snow, like dust, has settled <b>deep</b>,<br>
        And in the shadows, creatures <b>sleep</b>.<br>
        <br>
        A path unworn, a distant <b>trail</b>,<br>
        Where footfalls fade and winds <b>prevail</b>.<br>
        The branches stretch, both soft and <b>bare</b>,<br>
        To speak of things that wander <b>there</b>.<br>
        <br>
        The brook has frozen, still and <b>wide</b>,<br>
        Its murmurs lost beneath the <b>tide</b>.<br>
        Yet in the silence, I still <b>here</b>,<br>
        A whisper only I come <b>near</b>.<br>
        <br>
        It calls me on, beyond the <b>gate</b>,<br>
       Where roads divide and hearts <b>await</b>.<br>
       The road I take is not the <b>same</b>,<br>
       But all the woods, they call my <b>name</b>.<br>
